# Enhancing Road Safety with Audio Alerts

## Overview

This project focuses on improving road safety by detecting road signboards and providing corresponding audio alerts. It is designed to assist drivers by ensuring they receive real-time notifications about important road signs, reducing distractions and enhancing awareness.

## Features

- **Road Sign Detection:** Uses deep learning models to detect and recognize road signs from a camera feed.
- **Audio Alerts:** Converts detected road signs into corresponding voice messages for driver awareness.
- **Mobile Implementation:** Successfully integrated into an Android application for real-time use.
- **Raspberry Pi Implementation (In Progress):** Working on deploying the model on a Raspberry Pi for standalone edge processing.

## Technology Stack

- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilized Ultralytics YOLO for object detection.
- **Android App:** Developed using Android Studio and integrated with a camera module.
- **Audio Output:** Text-to-speech (TTS) conversion for delivering audio alerts.
- **Raspberry Pi (Upcoming):** Optimizing the model for edge computing on Raspberry Pi.

## Installation & Usage

### Android App

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/road-safety-audio-alerts.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Build and install the APK on your mobile device.
4. Allow camera permissions and run the application to start detecting road signs.

### Raspberry Pi (Upcoming)

- Setup instructions will be added once the implementation is completed.

## Future Enhancements

- Optimizing the deep learning model for better performance on low-power devices.
- Enhancing support for multiple languages in audio alerts.
- Expanding compatibility to other embedded systems.
